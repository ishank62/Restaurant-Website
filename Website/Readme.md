## Introduction
This is a Restaurant Website with frontend made using Angularjs & with backend made using Nodejs
## Web tools 
1.	Bower             :   Package Manager for the Web 
2.	Grunt & Gulp :  Task Automation
3.	Yo                     : Web App scaffolding
4.	Yeoman           : Workflow designed around using Yo, Bower and Gulp

###	Js Frameworks : 
1.	Single page application
2.	 Model – view- controller
       Task runners:
1. Minification : Removing unnecessary characters to reduce size
2. Concatenation : Removing unnecessary characters to reduce size
3. Js Hint : Checks for syntax errors for potential error.
4. Uglification : Minification + Mangling (reduce local variables to single letters)
5. Rechecking for errors
6. Images: Optimization of images to reduce size
7. Watch : To keep a watch on all the above if a change happens we don’t have to manually do it again.
8. Server &/ Livereload : Serves up the compiled code (Live Reload).Automatically reload anytime when anything changes.
9. Building site for deployment.

### Dependency Injection : 
Software Design pattern that implements inversion of control for resolving dependencies.
1. Dependency : Object that can be used(a service).
	2. Injection : Passing of a dependency to a dependent object so that it can use it.
Client doesn’t need to build an object.
1. Creating Angular templates
2. SPA(Single paged applications) : 
(i) No need to reload the entire page.
(ii) Most resources are retrieved with a single page load.
(iii) Redraw parts og the page when needed without requiring a full round trip.
3. Data binding : one way & two way
4. MVC/MVVM/MVW framework support
5. Views ->Tempaltes + controller + Model
6. Location & Routing

#### Server : 
(i)	Serves up data using REST Api.
(ii)	Supplies the static HTML pages , Angular templates & resources.
Rendering of view is completely based on client side
(i)	Templating & Routing(How we move from one template to another)

	Deep Linking : Hyperlink that specifies a link to a searchable or indexed piece of web content.
Ex: http://www. confusion.food/index.html#/menu/0

Note:Any change  following the hash in the url doesn’t lead to  page reload . If anything to the right of the hash changes, browser doesn’t cause any page reload.(SPAs property).

#### Location Service:
1) Exposes the current URL in the browser address bar.
2)Synchronises the URL with the browser when the user:
	(i) Changes the address bar.
	(ii)Clicks on the back/Forward buttons
	(iii)Clicks on a link
3) Allows you to manipulate the hash portion of a URL.


=> Routing : Mapping the path portion of a URL to a handler for that particular route using ngRoute module.
    Ex: https://www.confusion.food/index.html#/menu/0

=> Networking: Json-server
=> Promise function: When we initiate asynchronous operation, promise comes back & tells what  happened.

=> RESTful API
=> Unit Testing: Karma & Jasmine
=> End 2 End Testing: Protractor
